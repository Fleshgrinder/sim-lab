Script that check if the [GT1 EVO Sim Racing Cockpit] is in stock and then shows a Windows Toast that informs you to go and get yours. I highly recommend
that you get an account on their site and put everything in the cart that you want to order along. It remembers your cartâ€™s content if you are registered
and this will speed up your checkout.

## Usage

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/): `winget install --id python.python.3`
- Provision `venv`: `python3 -m venv venv`
- Edit the script and assign your email address to the `EMAIL` variable at the top, you want to be a good web citizen and let the Sim-Lab admins know who
  is probing their server over and over again. ðŸ˜‰
- Start the script: `.\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\main.py`
- Have fun!
